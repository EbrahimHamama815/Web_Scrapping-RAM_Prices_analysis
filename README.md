# Web_Scrapping-RAM_Prices_analysis

Due to the increased need for Hardware for AI development, There is a shortage in hardware and prices went up drastically,
so it may be a bit tough to make a purchase. Thats excactly the goal of this project.

In this project we use python to scrap computer memory (RAM) product pages to collect info about the currently available
products using requests and beautiful soup and then we proccess the data using pandas, and finally we load the data
into Power BI to create the final dashboard to have an over view of the available products and determine the best value product.


```python
print("hhhhh")
```


You can find the Crode in the Scripts folder and the Dashboard <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWIwYWMxZTctZWEwZS00NmY0LWI2ZjktYWY2YWViMTNmMzllIiwidCI6IjU5ZDRjODc4LTE4NTEtNDFkNC05ZmVmLTY5MzE2ODYyMjI5OCJ9">Here.</a>
